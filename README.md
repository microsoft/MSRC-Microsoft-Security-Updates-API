# Welcome
Microsoft provides an API for programmatic access to security update details using [Common Vulnerability Reporting Format](http://www.icasi.org/cvrf/). View our [blog post](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2016/11/08/furthering-our-commitment-to-security-updates/) for more info. 

The Microsoft [Security Update Guide](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide) is the web experience to find security update detail.

This repository contains sample code and documentation for the Microsoft Security Updates API (https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/developer), including:
* source code for the [MsrcSecurityUpdates PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MsrcSecurityUpdates)
* sample code for using the [MsrcSecurityUpdates PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MsrcSecurityUpdates)
* OpenAPI/Swagger definition for the Microsoft Security Updates API

# Getting the MsrcSecurityUpdates PowerShell Module
Getting started with the MsrcSecurityUpdates module can be done like this:
```PowerShell
### Install the module from the PowerShell Gallery
Install-Module -Name MsrcSecurityUpdates -Scope CurrentUser

### Load the module if PowerShell is at least version 5.1
if ($PSVersionTable.PSVersion -gt [version]'5.1') {
 Import-Module -Name MsrcSecurityUpdates
}
```
Once the module is loaded, check out our [PowerShell samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/MSRC-Microsoft-Security-Updates-API/blob/master/src/README.md)
